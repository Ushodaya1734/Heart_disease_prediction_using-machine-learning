# Heart_disease_prediction_using-machine-learning
Heart disease can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle changes, 
medicine and, in some cases, surgery. With the right treatment, the symptoms of 
heart disease can be reduced and the functioning of the heart improved. The predicted results
can be used to prevent and thus reduce cost for surgical treatment and other expensive.

 Conclusion:

The overall aim is to define various data mining techniques useful in effective heart disease prediction.
Efficient and accurate prediction with a lesser number of attributes and tests is our goal. In this study,
We consider only 14 essential attributes. We applied 6 data mining classification techniques,
K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes,Decision tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random forest. 
The data were pre-processed and then used in the model. Decision Tree and Random Forest 
are the algorithms showing the best results in this model.
